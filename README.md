# US Energy Consumption analysis 

## Description

We consider data from the US Energy Information Administration’s online data browser.The data was downloaded from Table 2.2 of the US Energy Information Administration’s online data browser (https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/browser/). The data set contains multiple time series, detailing:

* Primary US residential energy consumption patterns per energy source (Fossil Fuels and Renewable Energy) from 1949 until 2021.
* Electricity Retail Sales
* Electrical System Energy Losses

The aim of this study is to analyse the monthly residential energy consumption in the US, since January 2000.We will consider two cases:

* one of the time series in the dataset.
* multiple time series in the dataset.
